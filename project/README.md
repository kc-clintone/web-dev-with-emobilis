###Introduction
This is a final project activity for the emobilis web develipment bootcamp where
 I've learnt to build scalable, reliable, robust and maintainable web sites and webapps using Django and other technologies.

This project is to demonstrate the skills I have gathered throughout the course.

###Description
Frontend with Next.js and Bootstrap:
I will be utilising Next.js for the frontend to take advantage of its React-based framework for building robust and efficient web applications. I will use bootstrap to ensure a responsive and visually appealing user interface. Leveraging Bootstrap's pre-designed components for a consistent and user-friendly design. Implementing features like course listings, user profiles, and interactive lessons.

Backend with Django:
Here Django, a high-level Python web framework, serves as the backend to manage data, authentication, and business logic. Utilizing Django's ORM for efficient database interactions. Implementing user authentication to ensure secure access to courses, user profiles, and progress tracking. Leveraging Django REST Framework to create a robust API for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.

Key Features:
1. User Authentication: I will implement secure user authentication for students, instructors, and administrators.
2. Course Management: This will allow instructors to create, edit, and manage courses with diverse content types such as videos, quizzes, and assignments.
3. Progress Tracking: This will provide students with the ability to track their course progress, completed assignments, and overall achievements.
4. Interactive Learning Materials: Using Next.js to create interactive and dynamic learning materials, enhancing the overall user experience.
5. AI integration: In future, after project is approved, the app will be integrated with AI to enable even more fantastic user experience.
6. And more...

Scalability and Extensibility:
This app/system will be designed with scalability in mind, allowing it to handle a growing number of courses and users. I will make the codebase modular, facilitating future enhancements and feature additions.
